# Part A: Instantiation

# Define a BusTrip class that is initialized with a destination,
# a bus company, and a price for the trip.
# Preserve the arguments as attributes on the object.
# The choice of whether to use protected attributes is up to you.

class BusTrip():
    def __init__(self, destination, company, price):
        self._destination = destination
        self._company = company
        self._price = price

# Part B: String Representation

# The string representation of a BusTrip object must be a string in the form of:
#    "You paid 24.99 to Greyhound to go to Boston.""
# In this example, “Boston” is the destination, “Greyhound” is the bus company, and 24.99 is the price.
# These are all fed in as arguments when a BusTrip object is initialized.

    def __str__(self):
        return f"you paid {self._price} to {self._company} to go to {self._destination}."

    # Part C: Equality

    # Implement equality logic between two different BusTrip objects.
    # Two BusTrips object are considered equal if:
    #   -- they have the same destination
    #   -- their price is within 3 dollars of each other
    # HINT: Use Python’s abs function to calculate the absolute value of a number.
    def __eq__(self, other_trip):
        same_destination = self._destination == other_trip._destination  # Boolean
        insignificant_price_difference = abs(
            self._price - other_trip._price) <= 3  # Boolean
        return same_destination and insignificant_price_difference

        # Sample Execution
boston1 = BusTrip(destination="Boston", company="Greyhound", price=24.99)
boston2 = BusTrip(destination="Boston", company="Megabus", price=22.99)
boston3 = BusTrip(destination="Boston", company="Megabus", price=49.99)
philly = BusTrip(destination="Philadelphia", company="Peter Pan", price=12.99)

print(boston1)            # You paid 24.99 to Greyhound to go to Boston.
print(boston1 == philly)  # False - different destinations
# True - same destination and insignificant price difference
print(boston1 == boston2)
print(boston1 == boston3)  # False - large price difference
