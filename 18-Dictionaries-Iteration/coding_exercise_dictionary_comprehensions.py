# You are writing a Python program to model a remote control
# for a television set. Declare a stations_to_numbers
# function that accepts a dictionary. The keys will be
# channel numbers and the values will be the station names.
# For example...
# channels = {
#   2: "CBS",
#   4: "NBC",
#   5: "FOX",
#   7: "ABC"
# }
# The stations_to_numbers function should return an
# inverted dictionary where the keys are the station names
# and the values are the channel numbers
#
# stations_to_numbers(channels) => {'CBS': 2, 'NBC': 4, 'FOX': 5, 'ABC': 7}

# The keys of the dictionary will be strings representing roller coasters
# The values will be the heights of each coaster in meters

# The final values (in feet) should also be rounded to the closest integer
# HINT: 1 meter is equal to 3.28084 feet
# HINT: The round function rounds a number to the nearest integer
